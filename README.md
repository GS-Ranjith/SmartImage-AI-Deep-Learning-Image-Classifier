🖼 VisionAI – Deep Learning Image Classifier

VisionAI is a Streamlit-based web application that classifies uploaded images using a pretrained MobileNetV2 deep learning model trained on ImageNet.

Users can upload an image, and the AI model predicts the top 3 possible categories with confidence scores.
